# Typesharp

[![Discord](https://discord.com/api/guilds/750186214690258975/embed.png)](https://discord.gg/NcX3QgN6hp)

Typesharp is a typesafe compiled language written in rustlang aiming to memory safe and fast! <br />
You can view the [documentation here](https://github.com/TypeSharp/Documentation).

**NOTICE:** This is a rewrite of the original compiler, and therefore is public.

## Why Typesharp?

- Typesharp is fast, and memory safe!
- Super syntactic sugar.
- Explicit by default.
- Strategic compiler optimizations to optimize your code.


## Installation
This is the TypeSharp source code! It **does not** contain the CLI (Command line interface) or the "errors" module which provides lint.
